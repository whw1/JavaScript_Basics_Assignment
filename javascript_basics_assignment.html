           <h2> JavaScript Basics </h2>
             <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small and
              lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside a host
              environment(a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over
              them.
              <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.google.com">Variable Declaration</a>JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values-imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup
                  holds the coffee,a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers. Var x;</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.google.com">Variable Assignment</a>  Assignment operators assign value to JavaScript variables – our cup can now have coffee poured in it,
                   giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. Var x =10</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.google.com">Data Types</a> Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types
                that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean- true or false; null- null aka nothing; Number- 42 or 3.14159; String- “Coding Dojo Rocks!”;
                Array-[1,’Coding’, 2, ‘dojo’]; and Object- {first_name: ‘Jane’, last_name: ‘Doe’}</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.google.com">Conditionals</a> When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions – hitting different code blocks based on
                Values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following
                Conditional statements: if a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block; else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first
                Condition is false; else we execute this block of code;</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.google.com">Loops</a> There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat
                An action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. That’s a loop!</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.google.com">Functions</a> Functions are an encapsulation of a code block. When we call our function, this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of
                Instructions. As an example, imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we
                Screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more
                Tables to do so let’s call our function over and over and over again.</li>
